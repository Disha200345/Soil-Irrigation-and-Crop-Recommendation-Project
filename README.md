# Crop-Recommendation-Project
****🌾 Crop Recommendation System****

****📌 Overview****

This project is a machine learning-based **crop recommendation system** that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental conditions like **NPK levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall**.

The system leverages machine learning and data-driven analysis to recommend crops that enhance agricultural yield while promoting long-term sustainability and resource efficiency. This helps farmers make informed decisions based on soil and climate conditions, ultimately improving productivity and supporting sustainable agriculture.

****✨ Features****

* Predicts the best crop based on soil and climate data.
* Supports **multiple models** for comparison:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * LSTM (Deep Learning)
  * CNN-LSTM (Deep Learning)
* Displays accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.
* Visual bar chart comparing model performance.

****⚙️ Requirements****

* Python 3.x
* Libraries:

  * `pandas`, `numpy`
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  * `scikit-learn`
  * `keras`, `tensorflow`

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

****📊 Dataset****

The dataset used is `Crop_recommendation.csv` and contains the following features:

* **N**: Nitrogen
* **P**: Phosphorus
* **K**: Potassium
* **temperature**: in °C
* **humidity**: in %
* **ph**: soil pH value
* **rainfall**: in mm
* **label**: crop name (target variable)

****🚀 Usage****

* Upload the dataset (`Crop_recommendation.csv`) in your Colab or local project.
* Run the notebook step-by-step:

  * Preprocess data (encoding, scaling)
  * Train models
  * Evaluate performance
* View accuracy, confusion matrix, and model comparison bar chart.
* Try changing model parameters to improve results.

****🧐 Model Implementation****

* **Logistic Regression**: Simple baseline model
* **Decision Tree**: Rule-based classification
* **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
* **LSTM**: Deep learning model for sequential data
* **CNN-LSTM**: Hybrid deep learning model combining CNN and LSTM layers

Each model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix (normalized in %)
* Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

****🔮 Future Improvements****

* Develop a web interface using **Flask** or **Streamlit**.
* Integrate real-time user input.
* Experiment with more advanced models like **XGBoost** or **transformers**.
* Deploy the system on the cloud (e.g., **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Streamlit Cloud**).
* Add location-based predictions using GPS and satellite data.
